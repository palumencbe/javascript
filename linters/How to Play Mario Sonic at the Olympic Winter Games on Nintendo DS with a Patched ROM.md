In this article, we will show you how to get and use a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games on Nintendo DS.
  
## Step 1: Download a Patched ROM File
  
The first thing you need to do is to download a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games. You can find one on various websites that offer ROM downloads for Nintendo DS games, such as WoWroms[^1^] or ConsoleRoms[^2^]. Make sure you download the USA version of the game, as the patch only works for that region.
  
Alternatively, you can also patch your own ROM file if you have a clean copy of the game. To do this, you need to download a patching tool called Mario And Sonic At The OlymÃ­c Winter Games (U) [4274] Fix Patch[^3^] from GBATemp. Then, run the tool and select your clean ROM file when prompted. The tool will automatically patch your ROM file and save it as a new file.

Once you have a patched ROM file for Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, you need to transfer it to your device. Depending on what device you are using, there are different ways to do this.
  
If you are using an emulator on your computer or smartphone, such as DeSmuME or DraStic, you just need to copy the patched ROM file to the folder where your emulator stores its games. Then, launch your emulator and select the game from its menu.
  
If you are using a flashcard on your Nintendo DS, such as R4 or Acekard, you need to copy the patched ROM file to the microSD card that goes into your flashcard. Then, insert the microSD card into your flashcard and insert the flashcard into your Nintendo DS. Turn on your Nintendo DS and select the game from your flashcard's menu.
